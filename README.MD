# Fake-URL-Detector

### Project Definition:
The main goal of this project is to find the whether the given sites are legit or fake. The dataset has legits sites(labeled as 0) and  fake sites(labeled as 1). 
This is a **Classification Problem** because the outcome of this project should be either 1 or zero. so we are going to use Classification Algorithms like 
**Random Forest**,**Decision Trees**,**Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machines** and we'll find which algorithm gives us the best accuracy score 
and we are going to use **TfidVectorizer** for tokenizing the words.

### The decision tree algorithm gave us the best accuracy score of 91 and above.

## The machine learning model has been deployed using heroku.
